Since Sitecore Courier has no proper release management and we need some extra features,
we use a custom build here.

Custom features:
- New command line option '-collisionBehavior' with possible values force, skip and undefined

The current binaries are a release build of the commit 65bd1264d1
(https://github.com/unic/Sitecore-Courier/commit/65bd1264d1e9887915a0ce5e2bfe906c20ccbe844)
